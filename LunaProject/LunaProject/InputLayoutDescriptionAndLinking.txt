Linking (seems extremely loose?) between attributes of vertices fed into the pipeline via the
	D3D_INPUT_LAYOUT_DESC

When we create an ID3D12PipelineState object, we must specify both the input layout description and vertex shader.  Direct3D will 
then validate the input layout description and vertex shader are compatible.

Vertex data and input signature do not need to match exactly.  The vertex data just needs to provide all the information the 
vertex shader expects. The vertex data can, therefore, hold additional data.

There's also loose typing, so the vertex shader CAN reinterpret data like floats to ints when the types don't match... hmmmm...
