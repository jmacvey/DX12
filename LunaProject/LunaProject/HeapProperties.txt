-- From D3D12Resource

GPU resources live in heaps, which are blocks of GPU memory with certain properties.  The 

ID3D12::CreateCommittedResource method creates and commits a resource to a particular heap with the props we specify.

HRESULT ID3D12Device::CreateCommittedResource(
	const D3D12_HEAP_PROPERTIES *pHeapProperties,
	D3D12_HEAP_MISC_FLAG HeapMiscFlags,
	const D3D12_RESOURCE_DESC *pResourceDesc,
	D3D12_RESOURCE_USAGE initialResourceState,
	const D3D12_CLEAR_VALUE *pOptimizedClearValue,
	REFIID riidResource,
	void **ppvResource
);


typedef struct D3D12_HEAP_PROPERTIES {
	D3D12_HEAP_TYPE		Type;
	D3D12_CPU_PAGE_PROPERTIES CPUPageProperties,
	D3D12_MEMORY_POOL	MemoryPoolPreference,
	UINT				CreationNodeMask,
	UINT				VisibleNodeMask
};

1. pHeapProperties
	- properties of the heap we want to commit the resource to.  Some of the properties ar efor advanced usage.  

	D3D12_HEAP_TYPE:
		
		D3D12_HEAP_TYPE_DEFAULT: Default heap.  Where we commit resources solely accessed by the GPU.  E.g. DSV buffer.
		D3D12_HEAP_TYPE_UPLOAD: Upload heap.  Upload data from CPU to GPU
		D3D12_HEAP_TYPE_READBACK: Read-back heap.   Read data from GPU to CPU
		D3D12_HEAP_TYPE_CUSTOM: For advanced usage scenarios


2. HeapMiscFlags:  Additional flags about heap we want to commit the resource to.  Usually D3D12_HEAP_MISC_NONE

3. pResourceDesc: Pointer to a D3D12_RESOURCE_DESC instance describing the resource we want to create

4. InitialResourceState: Resources has a current usage state.  Usually D3D12_RESOURCE_USAGE_INITIAL, then transition to D3D12_RESOURCE_USAGE_DEPTH

5. pOptimizedClearValue:  Pointer to a D3D12_CLEAR_VALUE object that describes an optimized value for clearing resources.  Clear calls that match the
optimized clear value can potentially be faster than clear calls that do not match the optimized clear value.

struct D3D12_CLEAR_VALUE {
	DXGI_FORMAT Format;
	union {
		FLOAT Color [ 4 ];
		D3D12_DEPTH_STENCIL_VALUE DepthStencil;
	};
} D3D12_CLEAR_VALUE;

6. riidResource: The COM ID of the ID3D12Resource interface we want to obtain a pointer to

7. ppvresource:  Returns a pointer to a ID3D12Resource that represents the newly created resource
