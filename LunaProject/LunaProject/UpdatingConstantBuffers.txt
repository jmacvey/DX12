-- From CreatingConstantBuffers

Constant buffer is created wiht the heap type D3D12_HEAP_TYPE_UPLOAD, we can upload
data from the CPU to the constant buffer resource.  To do this, we first obtain a pointer
to the resource data:

ComPtr<ID3D12Resource> mUploadBuffer;
BYTE* mMappedData = nullptr;

mUploadBuffer->Map(0, nullptr, reinterpret_vast<void**>(&mMappedData));
// 1. Index identifying the subresource to map (buffer only has itself as index, so we put 0)
// 2. Optional pointer to a D3D12_RANGE structure that describes the range of memory to map (null specifies entire resource)
// 3. Third parameter is a storage value for map (stores the pointer to the memory in mMappedData)

To copy data from system memory to the constant buffer, just do memcpy

memcpy(mMappedData, &data, dataSizeInBytes);

When done, unmap it before releasing the memory
if(mUploadBuffer != nullptr) {
	mUploadBuffer->Unmap(0, nullptr);
}

mMappedData = nullptr;
