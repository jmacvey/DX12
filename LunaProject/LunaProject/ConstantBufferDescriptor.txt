-- From Updating Constant Buffers

After Creating the constant buffer resource and copying system memory to it, we need to create a descriptor:


// first create the descriptor heap (didn't need to do this for verte buffer views)
Descriptor Heap is of type D3D12_DESCRIPTOR_HEAP_TYPE_CBV_SRV_UAV

D3D12_DESCRIPTOR_HEAP_DESC cbvHeapDesc;
cbvHeapDesc.NumDescriptors = 1;
cbvHeapDesc.Type = D3D12_DESCRIPTOR_HEAP_TYPE_CBV_SRV_UAV;
cbvHeapDesc.Flags = D3D12_DESCRIPTOR_HEAP_FLAG_SHADER_VISIBLE; // <- indicates shaders will access this resource
cbvHeapDesc.NodeMask = 0;

ComPtr<ID3D12DescriptorHeap> mCbvHeap;
md3dDevice->CreateDescriptorHeap(&cbvHeapDesc, IID_PPV_ARGS(&mbvHeap));

// There is a descriptor for every object in the scene, and the descriptor will be of type CBV (constant buffer view)
