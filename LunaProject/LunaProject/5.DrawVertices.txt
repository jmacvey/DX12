-- From 4. Bind View to Pipeline


Once view is bound, we draw the vertices by calling the

ID3D12CommandList::DrawInstanced(
	UINT VertexCountPerInstance,
	UINT InstanceCount,
	UINT StartVertexLocation,
	UINT StartInstanceLocation
);

1. VertexCountPerInstance - The number of vertices to draw (per instance)

2. InstanceCount - Used for instancing (set to 1 for now )

3. StartVertexLocation - Specifies index of the first vertex in the vertex buffer to begin drawing

4. StartInstanceLocation - Used for instancing (set to 0 for now)


Note before crawing, you need to set the primitive topology to know what kind of primitives the vertices define:

Example:

ID3D12GraphicsCommandList::IASetPrimitiveTopology
----

cmdList->IASetPrimitiveTopology(D#D_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLELIST);
