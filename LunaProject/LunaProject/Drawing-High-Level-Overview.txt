1. Vertices and Indices and semantic mappings created in system memory
2. They are copied into an UPLOAD_RESOURCE_HEAP by CPU
3. Then copied from UPLOAD heap to DEFAULT heap (GPU only)
4. Resource views (descriptors) are created to describe the location and type of buffer
5. Resource views are bound to the rendering input assembler stage in the pipeline
6. We issue the draw commands for the corresponding views

1. Vertex shader can map the position of the vertex to corresponding homogeneous clip space
2. Vertex shader can store more information to pass to next pipeline stages
