From 3.CreateVertexBufferView

-- After vertex and corresponding descriptor (view) have been created, we can bind it to the input slot of the pipeline to feed the vertices
to the input assembler stage of the pipeline.  Done with following:

void ID3D12GraphicsCommandList::IASetVertexBuffers(
	UINT StartSlot,
	UINT NumBuffers,
	const D3D12_VERTEX_BUFFER_VIEW *pViews
);

1. StartSlot - The input slot to start binding vertex buffers to [0-15],
2. NumBuffers - The number of vertex buffers we are binding to the input slots
	If start slot has index k and binding n buffers, then binding buffers to input slots k ... k + n - 1
3. pViews - Pointer to first element in vertex buffer view array


// Vertex buffer will stay bound to an input slot until it's changed.
